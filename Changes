Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::MailPage.

1.7 (May 14, 2010)
    - Fixed problem with our $VERSION (RT #57477 && RT #41697) - gary@sitesuite.com.au

1.6 (Oct 31, 2005)
    - Fixed vulnerability where newlines could be embedded in subject, 
        name, etc and used to create a completely custom message for spammers.
        Validation is now performed by Data::FormValidator and can be customized
        by 'validation_profile'.
        # NOTE - the older 'alert' parameter is still passed into the form template
        # as the first error message encountered on the form. This exists for backwards
        # compatability but should be considered deprecated.
    - Added 'max_emails_per_request' and 'max_emails_per_hour' to avoid
        being used as a spam relay.
    - Added original requestor's IP address to the outgoing email headers
        to avoid being seen as the sender if the message is hijacked for spam
1.5 (Oct  3, 2005)
    - Fixed vulnerability in the translation of page param into
        file name. Allowed someone to maliciously put '../../', etc
        into the file name and retrieve arbitrary documents from the
        file system if remote_fetch was not enabled.
1.4 (Oct 19, 2004)
    - Fixed bug with regard to 'acceptable_domains' if 'page' has
        a port number.
1.3 (Oct 11, 2004)
    - Added 'acceptable_domains' param to restrict the domain
        of the page to mail (protection against spam)
    - Added 'remote_fetch' param to allow sending pages that
        aren't on local filesystem
    - Added 'extra_tmpl_params' param to further customize the
        processing of the templates.
    - Added 'format_options' tmpl_var that is available to the
        'form_template' to use instead of 'format_selector' if you
        want more control.
    - All templates now have 'die_on_bad_params' = 0 so that you aren't
        required to have all tmpl_params/tmpl_loops present in your templates
1.2 (Sep 9, 2004)
    - Build fix

    - now support port numbers in 'page' parameter
    - M. Peters is now co-maintainer
